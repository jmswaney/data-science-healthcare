# Data Science in Healthcare

Data science is a growing field at the intersection of machine learning and software engineering. 
From enabling novel patient-directed technologies to informing complex business decisions, data science has seen many emerging applications within biotechnology and medicine.
This Data Science in Healthcare course is meant to introduce STEM-oriented high school students to the concepts, tools, and applications of data science through individual, hands-on projects. 
Students will be introduced to the Python programming language as well as the ecosystem of tools most commonly used by data scientists in industry.
Then, each student will have an opportunity to work on an individualized data science project with professional supervision and guidance. 
The projects can range from a variety of topics, including bioinformatics, cancer detection, and language impairment diagnosis. 
The course will culminate in a written report and student showcase to effectively communicate their work. The student will be awarded a certificate upon the successful completion of the course.
